Description: Coco/R Compiler Generator (C++ Version)
 Coco/R is a compiler generator, which takes an attributed grammar of
 a source language and generates a scanner and a parser for this
 language. The scanner works as a deterministic finite automaton. The
 parser uses recursive descent. LL(1) conflicts can be resolved by a
 multi-symbol lookahead or by semantic checks. Thus the class of
 accepted grammars is LL(k) for an arbitrary k.
 .
 Use the command 'coco-cpp' to start Coco/R.
