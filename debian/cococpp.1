.SH NAME
cococpp \- Coco/R Compiler Generator (C++ Version)

.SH HINT

By default cococpp expects the Parser.frame and Scanner.frame file to be
in the same directory as the grammar (atg-file) to translate. As the 
frame files are architecture independent, the default frame files can be
found in /usr/share/coco-cpp/.

.SH SEE ALSO

See package coco-doc for documentation.
